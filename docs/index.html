        <!--if you need quotes use <q></q> and for apostrophes that don't work use &#39-->
        <p> <q>When you educate a girl, you kick-start a cycle of success. It makes economic sense. It makes social sense. It makes moral sense. But, it seems it&#39s not common sense yet.</q> -Queen Rania of Jordan </p>

        <p>According to UNESCO, <b>52% - 95% of girls in these countries have never been to school.</b> These developing nations would be a better place socially, economically, and morally if they provided girls with education. Economically, educating girls results in more of the population joining the workforce. Socially, woman have a lot to contribute to society. Morally, women are just as eligible for an  education as men are. They deserve the education that every other girl receives, and yet, because of mere circumstance, these girl's educations are neglected. They lose the opportunity to learn about the world around them and start a career that could support their families. </p>

        <p>The goal of <i>To Girls Everywhere</i> is to connect people to information regarding female education in developing countries and organizations that sponsor them. <i>To Girls Everywhere</i>  also aims to inspire empathy and compassion for the girls in developing countries.  All girls in America must be educated by law. Education is taken for granted. Yet girls in developing countries are missing out on the experience.  We, who are fortunate enough to have a great educational system, have the ability to help these girls. There is a problem, but we have the ability to end it. Today, we can change the world. Today we can achieve the dream of Queen Rania of Jordan. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Today, we can bring equality to the world.</b></p>
