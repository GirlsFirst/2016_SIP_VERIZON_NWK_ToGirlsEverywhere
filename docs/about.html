        <p>Designing, coding, and playing video games are the biggest parts of my life. I have been playing for as long as I can remember. I believe my gaming interest also expands through many different genres. I love all kinds of games from horror to Mario, to first-person shooters, to indie. Playstation to Xbox, 3DS to iOS, PC to board games. I also love drawing, sketching, painting, and designing. Currently, three of my sketchbooks are full and two more are on the way; including a digital sketchbook. Experimenting with all the different tools is so much fun! This is actually how I got into code. I took a web design class and fell in love with HTML and CSS.</p>

        <p>Running, helping animals, video editing, and traveling are a few of my passions. I used to live in Chile for 16 years of my life. Recently I have moved to the United States. All my family and friends lived in Chile, and it was very hard to leave, but I'm glad I did it. Now I'm living with my dad, stepmom, and little brother. When I grow up I want to do something I really enjoy, including working with physics and genetics, traveling, learning new things, and helping animals. I love doing track and field, especially doing sprints. In my free time, I like to sketch, spend time with my friends, and listen to music.</p>

        <p>Engineering, building, and creating have always excited me. In addition, I have always had a great fascination with science. I love using information I have learned in the sciences to brainstorm on projects that require engineering, coding, and circuitry to help solve problems. My dreams for the future include working in a laboratory, becoming an austronaut, designing computer games and board games, publishing a book, and building a satellite. Writing poetry is one of my favorite hobbies. I love to decipher abstract ideas and attempt to put them on paper.  I also like baking. Especially cookies.</p>
